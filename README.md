# Classification-of-Breast-Tumors
I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to thoroughly examine the distribution of variables and uncover significant relationships in the dataset. During the preprocessing phase, I standardized the independent variables to ensure uniformity, which is essential for improving the performance of machine learning models. Outliers were identified and removed using the z-score method to enhance the model's accuracy. Following this, I applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories. The model performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy of 97%, a precision of 98%, and an F1 score of 0.95, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in tumor classification tasks.
